### what is this?
this is my template for project documentation

### why am i making it?
i noticed how i documented projects on github lacked structure so i made an easy to use template. i went through a bunch of projects and figured out what was essential and what wasn't. you're welcome

### want to use it?
i plan to use this on all of my future projects and maybe some of my older ones (if i have the time). if you want to use this just fork the repository and clone it to your local computer or just clone this. i'm a n00b, idk

```
### on the github cli
gh repo clone dibrinsofor/readme-template
```
or 
```
git clone https://github.com/dibrinsofor/readme-template
```

### how it works
i am trying not to fill this with lorem ipsum so here goes, i'll just list users whose readme.md's i went through: @fathermerry, @victoridk

#### technologies
this was built entirely with love on an eventful day with:

- markdown
- <3

### what's coming next
i am not sure how much better you can make this, it's already pretty badass. maybe do a one pass for grammatical errors and keep going through repos to find new ways to make this colt even cooler. oooh! maybe make a library that'll auto generate a readme with this template

### want to help make this better?
you are a massive nerd if you want to contribute to this, i support you still. just make a pr with any changes you have or shoot me a dm on twitter

[//]: # (So depending on use case, you may want to keep the documentation short. in that case you may not need to include the last two sections or you can)
